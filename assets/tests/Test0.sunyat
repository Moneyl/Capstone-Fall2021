;;; Tests out various instructions, labels, variables, and the stack

; Basic variable and stack test
load r0 a
push r0
pop r1

; Testing reading/writing by memory address using constant. This is how ports work.
const one 1
add r2 one

mov r4 P_HEAT
mov r5 P_SPEDOMETER

mov r6 1
store P_SHOOT r6
mov r6 20
store P_TURRET_OFS r6 ; Keep rotating turret counter clockwise

; Defining these at the end to ensure variable definition order doesn't matter. Not recommended for clean code.
var a 2
var x_1234 -99
var _my_var10 15000

;Expected result:
;    r0: 2
;    r1: 2
;    r2: 32
;    r3: 15000 initially, increases by 1 each loop
;    r4: 0
;    r5: 0
;    r6: 0
;    r7: 0
